# Autonomous Trajectory Planning and Control

This repository explores the simulation and control of autonomous vehicles (drones or spacecraft) with a focus on **trajectory planning, control strategies, and AI-based methods**.  
The project is structured in **progressive modules**, each addressing a different aspect of aerospace/robotics engineering.

---

## Features (Planned & Implemented)
- âœ… Vehicle dynamics simulation (2D/3D models, disturbances, constraints)  
- ðŸ”„ Classical control: LQR / MPC for stabilization and trajectory tracking  
- ðŸ”„ Trajectory optimization: minimum-fuel or time-optimal missions  
- ðŸ”„ Reinforcement learning: training agents for autonomous guidance  
- ðŸ”„ Perception: computer vision for localization from synthetic imagery  

(*Check roadmap for progress tracking.*)

## Usage
Each module will have a dedicated script or notebook.  
Example (Step 1 â€“ vehicle dynamics simulation):
```bash
python dynamics_simulation.py
```

Outputs:  
- Time evolution of vehicle state  
- 2D/3D trajectory plots  
- Comparison between uncontrolled and controlled motion
